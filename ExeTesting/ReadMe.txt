This is a small python exe for looking at how long it would take to craft items in pathfinder 2e
based on it's level, cost, and your character's crafting skill. To use just follow the prompts
in the exe. Where (X/Y) is used it expects either 'X' or 'Y'. These could be Y/N or L/I.
To customize your default data, go to savedData.txt and proceed from there. Have fun crafting.
(Just put this shortcut to the exe wherever you want to run it from)
NOTE: This was a short term project, item names are exact so I would recommend typing them
the same as shown on Archives of Nethys 2e for ease of access.
